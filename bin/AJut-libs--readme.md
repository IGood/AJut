# Overview
The binary storage place of compiled ajut libraries. If locally built ajut binaries are part of your workflow, this folder will have them all co-located for ease of access.

# Libraries
## ajut.core
The core library, containing the baseline ideas, extensions, and utilities for building apps. This library has no UI/UX, and therefore can be used without any other dependencies.

## ajut.ux.wpf
The ux library built for wpf. This library is a container of controls, ui extensions, and user experience concepts (like stack navigation, and a docking framework).
