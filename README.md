# The AJut Libraries
C# / dotnet 5 / wpf - utility libraries, created by AJ Badarni

## Greetings
I hope you enjoy this library. AJut is short for AJ Utilities, (pronounced like the dipping sauce Au Jus).

The two libraries **ajut.core** and **ajut.ux.wpf** are intended to be effectively standalone project enhancers. They are controls, utilities, and paridigms I've built dating back to when I first got into c# and refined over the years.

The goal was to provide a simple project reference that will allow you to build and innovate without having to start completely from scratch or to have to bring in many many libraries to get things done.

Many of these utilities are my takes on ideas that *aren't* new - and yet those ideas have to be rewritten everywhere we develop... and I find that a shame. Other ideas and controls in here are of my own innovation! The unique difference is that everything is in support of how I like to develop, and I hope you will enjoy doing things the ajut way too!

## Thanks
As a matter of attribution, several of these utilities I have refined some with a friend, Ian Good. Thanks Ian!

## Final Message
I hope you are able to find AJut useful!

Thanks!
