# The AJut Libraries (Alpha)

C# Utility libraries, created by AJ Badarni

## Greetings
I hope you enjoy this library. AJut is short for AJ Utilities, (pronounced like the dipping sauce Au Jus). It represents some dot net utilities that I commonly use. I have an adapted version for Windows Universal that are included but require further evaluation as changes with .net core have been released.

## Licensing
This software uses an MIT License, see license.txt - terms and conditions contained therin.

## Versioning
At this point, AJut is in the "Alpha" stage. I have some large scale overhauls planned, as this library dates back to my early days as an engineer.

That being said, within the (hopefully very open) terms of the license, I'm happy to have anyone look at or use it now, just know that things may change rapidly. 


## Thanks
As a matter of attribution, several of these utilities I have refined some with a friend, Ian Good. Thanks Ian!

## Final Message
I hope you are able to find AJut useful!

Thanks!
