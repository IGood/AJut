# AJut.Core
C# / dotnet 5 utility library, created by AJ Badarni

## Greetings
I hope you enjoy using ajut.core. AJut is short for AJ Utilities, (pronounced like the dipping sauce Au Jus). This core library represents some dot net utilities that I have been building up since I first started developing - through the many side projects I've done over the years. The goal was to provide a simple project reference that will allow you to build and innovate without having to start completely from scratch or to have to bring in many many libraries to get things done.

Many of these utilities are my takes on ideas that aren't new - and yet those ideas have to be rewritten everywhere we develop... and I find that a shame. Many ideas in here are of my own innovation! The unique difference is that everything is in support of how I like to develop, and I hope you will enjoy doing things this way too!

## Final Message

Thanks!
